My config data for some tools I use in my daily work. I basically 
use zsh with oh-my-zsh, tmux with powerline and vim with nerdtree.

The powerline part can be easily installed via 'yum' or 'dnf'
using Fedora, e.g. 'powerline' and 'tmux-powerline'. Same goes 
for Nerdtree.

To fix some clipboard issues vim-x11 and xclip should be installed.
Then gvim will be automatically executed in terminal mode. The
reason is that vim is usally shipped without clipboard support, at
least in Fedora (see 'vim --version' for compile flags).
